# AETHER - Advanced Encrypted Tele-Health Evaluation & Reporting
AETHER is a decentralized medical intelligence platform. It bridges the gap between diagnostic accuracy and patient privacy by utilizing Federated Learning to train Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

In this architecture, raw medical data stays local to the provider, while only encrypted model updates are aggregated centrally. The result is an AI that can "see" a medical scan and "write" a clinical report without ever compromising data sovereignty.
